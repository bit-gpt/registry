## Description

Redis, short for Remote Dictionary Server, serves as a multifunctional in-memory data structure store. It functions as a distributed key-value database, cache, and message broker, all operating in-memory for high-speed data access. With optional durability, Redis ensures data persistence despite potential system failures.
