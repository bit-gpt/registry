    "description": "Dolly-v2-12b, developed by Databricks, is an instruction-following large language model trained on diverse capability domains. It exhibits remarkable instruction following behavior, surpassing the foundation model it's based on, Pythia-12b. The model is particularly designed for commercial use and its inference can be run on various GPU configurations. [Learn More](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b)",
