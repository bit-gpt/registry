## ðŸ“Œ Description

Redis, short for Remote Dictionary Server, serves as a multifunctional in-memory data structure store. It functions as a distributed key-value database, cache, and message broker, all operating in-memory for high-speed data access. With optional durability, Redis ensures data persistence despite potential system failures. <a href='https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/vector-database/' target='_blank'>Learn more</a> ðŸš€.

## ðŸ‘‡ Getting Started (Implementation)

The service can be used with Langchain. You can check the <a href='https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/redis.html' target='_blank'>official documentation</a>. In the code snippet below, weassume that you are using <a href='https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' target='_blank'>`all-miniLM-l6-v2`</a> model for embeddings generation and the service is running locally on port 8001.

```python

!pip install redis

import os

from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "random-string"

doc1 = Document(page_content="Prem is an easy to use open source AI platform. With Prem you can quickly build provacy preserving AI applications.")
