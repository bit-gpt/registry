    "description": "All-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a sentence-transformers model designed to map sentences and paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space, ideal for clustering or semantic search tasks. Developed during Hugging Face's Community week, this model is fine-tuned on a 1B sentence pairs dataset with a contrastive learning objective. It excels in encoding short texts, capturing semantic information, and is useful for information retrieval, clustering, or sentence similarity tasks.
