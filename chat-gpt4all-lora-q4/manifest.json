    "description": "GPT4All, developed by Nomic AI, is a chatbot trained over an extensive corpus of assistant interactions. By finetuning LLaMA 7B, GPT4All provides an open-source ecosystem to train and deploy efficient, assistant-style large language models locally on consumer-grade CPUs. This democratized approach to AI aims to bolster open research, reproducibility, and promote developments in AI alignment and interpretability. The current model has been 4-bit quantized using ggml framework. [Learn More](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all).",
